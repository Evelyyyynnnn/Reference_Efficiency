# Reference_Efficiency
Welcome to enjoy the reference efficiency world

This project is mainly used for improving your efficiency for reference because we all know that sometimes it's hard to copy every apa/mpa citation from scholar website like Google Scholar or IEEE.

- âœ¨ So here I made the `.py` to quickly get down the references you want and transform it into the in-text citation format in the `Reference_Citation.py`
  - And by the way, if you want to implement this on you own google searching website but without running the `py` file,then you just need to
    - (1) open eg. your google scholar searching engine
    - (2)Have the **Sider** as the extension to your Google Search
    - (3) Search one key word and copy the whole page of the content
    - (4) and then input anything you want to do with them including transferring them into the apa format

- And I also include some other small projects like you could use for key words searching with abstract in the `key_words_search.py`or helping yourself making the syllabus for the essay.

ðŸ†’ All you need to do is to replace the "Open-AI-Key" I left with your own key by logging in [this website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). And there is also another key from google required, you could refer to this article for the [completed tutorial](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43937790/article/details/138379785)(this is in Chinese,so maybe you could open the google extension to make it become English).


ðŸ˜Ž Now just enjoy the journey
